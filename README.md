# AI-driven Performance Analysis System - DiveIQ

## Overview
DiveIQ is an AI-powered performance analysis system designed for precision evaluation of competitive diving form. This project provides athletes and coaches with high-fidelity insights to enhance technique and minimize inefficiencies in short-distance events such as 50m and 100m swims. By leveraging high-resolution biomechanical assessments and predictive modeling, DiveIQ identifies, analyzes, and visualizes critical parameters of a dive sequence.

## Environment Variables
To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
PYTHON_VERSION=3.7
MEDIAPIPE_VERSION=0.10.0
OPENCV_VERSION=4.5.5.64
NUMPY_VERSION=1.21.6
```

## Requirements
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python==4.5.5.64 mediapipe==0.10.0 numpy==1.21.6
```

## Features
- **Real-time Dive Analysis:** Detects and analyzes key biomechanical parameters.
- **Performance Visualization:** Graphical representation of diving sequences.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses AI to suggest improvements in diving techniques.

## Usage
Run the main script to start the DiveIQ system:

```bash
python diveiq_main.py
```
