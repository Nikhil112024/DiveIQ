 AI-driven performance analysis system designed for the
 precision evaluation of competitive diving form. This project aims to equip athletes and coaches with
 high-fidelity insights to enhance technique and minimize performance inefficiencies in short-distance
 events like 50m and 100m swims. By using high-resolution biomechanical assessments and
 predictive modeling, DiveIQ identifies, analyzes, and visualizes critical parameters of a dive
 sequence.
